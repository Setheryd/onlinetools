2. Visit `/tools/qr-code-generator`
3. Try posting a comment
4. Check your Supabase dashboard to see the data

2. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
3. Check if tables were created in Supabase dashboard

### If you get database errors:
1. Make sure you ran both SQL scripts
2. Check Supabase logs for specific error messages
