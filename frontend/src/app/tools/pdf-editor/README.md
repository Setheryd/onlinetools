## Performance Considerations

- Large PDFs may take longer to load and process
- Complex documents with many pages may require more memory
- WebAssembly provides near-native performance for PDF operations
- Rendering is optimized with canvas-based display

## Browser Requirements

- JavaScript enabled
- WebAssembly support
- Sufficient memory for document processing
- Modern browser with ES6+ support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **File won't load**: Ensure it's a valid PDF file under 50MB
